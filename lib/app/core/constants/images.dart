// This class holds the paths to various images used in the application.
// It provides a centralized way to manage image assets, making it easier to reference them throughout the app.
// The paths are defined as static constants, allowing for easy access without needing to instantiate the class.
// The images include onboarding screens and login icons for Apple and Google.
// This approach helps in maintaining a clean codebase and avoids hardcoding image paths in multiple places.
